Lessons learned:
1. Problem: Every time the EC2 instance shuts off, the Public IPv4 DNS address would be reset with a new value.  Kubernetes config file references the DNS address, and once that changes, the config file becomes invalid.
Solution: Associate an Elastic IP address with the EC2 instance within AWS, which is like a proxy ip address which stays consistent no matter when the EC2 instance shuts off.  Then create a config file based off of the Elastic IP address DNS name.

2.Problem: The Jenkins application creates and uses a new user named 'jenkins' in order to perform any actions on the host.  Does not have many permissions to access other directories.Solution:  From Jenkins configuration, the working directory of the jenkins user is var/lib/jenkins/workspace or something similar. 
Solution: I created .kube folder within it and created a config file.  I copy pasted the contents of the kubernetes config file into that file and referenced it in the Jenkins file.

3. Problem: War file was corrupted.  When the jar -cvf... command creates the war file, it can ONLY include a directory with the necessary files, ie., the outer directory of WEB-INF.  Any other files included in the directory specified in the command will corrupt the war file.
Solution: modify the jar -cvf command to specify only the correct directory to build the war file as shown in the Jenkinsfile

4. Problem: After setting an image on the cluster using the kubectl set image command, nothing would happen.
Solution: The cluster needs to destroy the current pods with the old images and create new pods with the new image.  I added a kubectl rolling restart deployment/swe645hw2 command to the Jenkinsfile and it worked.

5. Problem: When creating the Jenkins pipeline, we were unable to get the github push webhooks working.
Solution: Turns out, we needed to uncheck the "Lightweight build" default checkbox at the bottom of the pipeline configuration page

6. Problem: When writing the Jenkinsfile, we were unable to have a plaintext password in the Jenkinsfile when logging into dockerhub.
Solution: We had to create an environment variable in the Manage Jenkins -> Global settings page called DOCKERHUB_PASS, and pass that into the login command

7. Problem: When attempting to run the Jenkinsfile, I got a "permission denied" on a docker command.
Solution: I needed to add the jenkins user to the docker group in the Jenkins host.  Requires a Reboot of the instance for the user group changes to take effect. (sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins)

8. Problem: When attempting to provision a cluster on an EC2 instance using Rancher, I received an error.  This issue thread details a very similar method, along with a potential solution that I did not try: https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/21926#issuecomment-517620288

9. Problem: When attempting to create an IAM service account user in AWS, I received an error.  Learner's Lab accounts are not allowed to create that type of service account
